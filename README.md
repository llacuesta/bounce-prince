# Instructions for Pushing
1. Always use the develop branch. All changes made should go through the develop branch first. Do not push anything to the main branch.
- `git checkout develop` to switch to develop branch
- `git pull` to make sure the copy you are using is updated

2. When creating a new feature, create a branch called `feature/[issue-number]/[feature-name]`. Make sure to be always in the develop branch first before creating a new branch.
- ex. (while in develop branch) `git checkout feature/01/new-level`
- issue numbers and feature names can be found here

3. When changes are done, push the changes to your branch. After pushing changes to your branch, something like this should appear: 
   ![Push](https://imgur.com/a/nJCydka)
   Click on compare & pull request to create a pull request.
- `git push origin [branch-name]` to push changes

4. Always check the issues tab to see task assignments.
